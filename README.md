# Tiny Web server GOAT - A deliberately insecure Web Server for exploiting training

### *WARNING 1*: While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program.

### *WARNING 2*: This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you. Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the first thing that all hackers claim.


This project is a binary exploiting lab based on this public repo [https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server](https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server)


## What

Every labs has the same vulnerable webserver binary running on docker container, try to navigate through single labs and follow instructions.
Every labs have specific learning objectives by example:
- Stack Buffer Overflow basics
- Return-oriented-programming exploiting technique
- Return-into-libc exploiting technique
- NX & ASLR bypass exploiting technique
- AddressSanitizer tool
- SPIKE fuzzer 
- etc.. etc...

## Why
Learn, Learn, Understand, Fail and Learn Again.
