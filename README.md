# Damn Vulnerable Tiny Web Server - A deliberately insecure webserver daemon for learning purpose


### *WARNING 1*: While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program.

This project is a binary exploiting lab based on this public repo [https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server](https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server)


## What

Every labs has the same vulnerable webserver binary running on docker container, try to navigate through single labs and follow instructions.
Every labs have specific learning objectives by example:
- Stack Buffer Overflow basics
- Return-oriented-programming exploiting technique
- Return-into-libc exploiting technique
- NX & ASLR bypass exploiting technique
- AddressSanitizer tool
- SPIKE fuzzer 
- etc.. etc...

## Why
Learn, Learn, Understand, Fail and Learn Again.
